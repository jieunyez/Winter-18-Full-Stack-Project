# Project 1: Build your first react application

## Due Date: Thursday, January 10, 2019 8:00 PM
## Objectives: To build your first react application without using any build tools and gain practice with our git workflow for distributiing course materials and submitting projects.

## Specifications/Requirements
1. Starting with the `main.html` starter file we have provided you with add the code to add a H1 element to the `h1-container`, a H2 element to the `h2-container` and a H3 element to the `h3-container` element. 
2. Additionally, provide css rules inside of the `style tag` element so that the same padding and back-ground color appears in all 3 containers but that the text inside of each container is a different size and color. You should only have 4 css rules inside of the style tag.

Note: You cannot use either pure javascript or JSX syntax to create your elements. Please use just the JSX syntax we discussed in class.
